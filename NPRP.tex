% After selecting your Research Opportunity to which you want to apply, contact the NASA Advisor or Point of Contact associated with that opportunity to discuss your research plan.
% Develop your research plan in collaboration with the prospective NASA Advisor
% You must submit a research proposal that responds to the goals and objectives described in the research opportunity you selected.
% Your proposal will be reviewed by the Center to assess its suitability for the research opportunity and, if suitable, will be reviewed by at least three external peer reviewers.
%
% Format of the Proposal
% The maximum length for the proposal is 15 pages, including figures and citations; double-spaced; 12-point font.
% Proposals for the NASA Postdoctoral Research Program should begin with a brief abstract, followed by the body of the proposal, which should contain these components:
%%% statement of problem,
%%% background and relevance to previous work,
%%% general methodology, procedures to be followed, and timeline for completion of each step;
%%% explanation of new or unusual techniques,
%%% expected results and their significance and application, and
%%% literature citations, where appropriate.
